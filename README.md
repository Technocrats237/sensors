# Sensors

This repository contains all sensor scrits.
For the moment, we are using a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.

## Dependencies
This repo depends on the Paho MQTT Python client library ([paho-mqtt v1.5.0](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt)) which implements versions 3.1 and 3.1.1 of MQTT protocol.
This client is used to publish (and subscribe) to sensor topics.

## Run
`$ python dht11.py`
